      <div class="line">
        Once in the sombre light of the throng'd courts of night,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In a dream-haunted land only inhabited
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        By the unhappy dead, came one who, anxious eyed,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Clung to my idle hand with clenched fingers weak
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And gazed into my eyes as he had wrongs to speak.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Silent he stood and wan, more pallid than the leaves
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of an aspen blown under a wind that grieves.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then I: 'O haggard one, say from what ghostly zone
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of thwarted destinies or torment hast thou come?
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Tell me thy race and name!' And he, with veiled face:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        'I have neither name nor race, but I have travelled far,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A timeless avatar of never-ending dooms,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out of those tyrannous glooms where, like a tired star
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In stormy darkness, looms the castle of Thamar...
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Once in a lonely dawn my eager spirit fared
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        By ways that no men dared unto a desert land,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where, on a sullen strand, a mouldering city, vast
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As towered Babylon, stood in the dreamy sand--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Older a million years: Babel was builded on
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That broken city's tears; dust of her crumbled past
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rose from the rapid wheels of Babel's charioteers
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In whorled clouds above those shining thoroughfares
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where Babel's millions tread on her unheeding dead.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Forth from an eastern gate where the lips of Asia wait
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Parch'd with an ancient thirst that no æons can abate,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Passed I, predestinate, to a thorn'd desert's drought,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where the rivers of the south, flowing in a cloudy spate,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Spend at last their splendid strength in a sea of molten glass
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Seething with the brazen might of a white sun dipped at length
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Like a baked stone, burning hot, plunged in a hissing pot.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Out of that solemn portal over the tawny waste,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Without stay, without haste, nor the joy of any mortal
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Glance of eye or clasp of hand, desolate, in a burning land,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Lonely days and nights I travelled and the changing seasons squandered
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Friendless, endlessly, I wandered nor my woven fate unravelled;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Drawn to a hidden goal, sore, forlorn with waiting,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Seeking I knew not what, yet unhesitating
      </div>
      <div class="line">

      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slow, beneath frozen snow, where the blind earth lay cringing,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Have I seen the steppe unfold uncounted blossomings,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where salty pools shone fair in a quivering blue air
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That shivered every fringing reed-bed with cool delight,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And fanned the mazy flight of slow-wing'd egrets white
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Beating and wheeling bright against the sun astare;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But I could not hear their wings for they were ghostly things
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sent by the powers of night to mock my sufferings
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And rain upon the bitter waterpools their drops aglitter.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Yet, when these lakes accursed tortured my aching thirst,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The green reeds fell to dust, the cool pools to a crust
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of frozen salt crystallised to taunt my broken lips,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To cheat my staring eyes, as a vision of great ships
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        With moving towers of sail, poops throng'd with grinning crowds
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And a wind in their shrouds, bears down upon the pale
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Wasted castaway afloat with the salt in his throat
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And a feeble wild desire to be quenched of his fire
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In the green gloom beneath.

      <div class="inner line-block">

        Hath a phantom city thrust to the visionary vault

      <div class="line">
        Of inviolate cobalt, dome and dreaming minaret
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Mosque and gleaming water-tower hazy in a fountain's jet
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or a market's rising dust; and my lips have cried aloud
      </div>

        To see them tremble there, though I knew within my heart
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They were chiselled out of cloud or carven of thin air;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And my fingers clenched my hand, for I wondered if this land
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of my stony pilgrimage were a glimmering mirage,
      </div>
      <div class="line">

        In a changing cloudy splendour; and beyond, in lakes of light,

      <div class="line">
        That drowns in a single night many a mud-made city;
      </div>

        And cities of boats, and frail cities of lath and reed,
      </div>
      <div class="line">

        Till a stranger nomad race drive their herds to the sad place

      <div class="line">
        Where old sorrows lie forgotten, and raise upon the rotten

        Tenderly, only dreading lest their petals delicate
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Should be broken by my treading, for I lived, I lived again,

        Of rapid cloud driven over the deeps of heaven

      <div class="line">
        In the roar of broken boulders split from rocky shoulders,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In the thunder of snow sliding, or under the appalling

      <div class="line">
        Rending of glacier ice or hoarse cataracts falling:

      <div class="line">
        That some demon gave me. Thrice I fell, and thrice

      <div class="line">
        In torrents of blue ice-water slipp'd and was toss'd
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Like a dead leaf, or a ghost

      <div class="line">
        Harried by thin bufferings of wind

      </div>
      <div class="line">

      <div class="line">
        Saw that the caverned room with shadowy forms was strewn
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In heavy sleep or swoon fallen, who did not move
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But lay as mortals lie in the sweet release of love.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And stark between them stood huge eunuchs of ebony,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Mute, motionless, as they had been carven of black wood.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But these I scarcely saw, for, through the flame was seen
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Another, a queen, with heavy closèd eyes
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        White against the skies of that empurpled night
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In her loveliness she lay, and leaned upon her hand:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And my blood leapt at the sight, so that I could not stand
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But fell upon my knees, pleading, and cried aloud
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        For her white loveliness as Ixion for his cloud:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And my cry the silence broke, and the sleepers awoke
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        From their slumber, stirred, and rose every one,--save those
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Mute eunuchs of ebony, those frowning caryatides.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slowly she looked at me, and when I cried again
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In yearning and in pain, she beckoned with her hand.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then from my knees rose I, and greatly daring,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Through the hazy air, past the brazier flaring
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And the hissing flame, crept, until I came
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unto the carven seat, and kissed her white feet;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And she smiled, but spake not.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        When she smiled the sleepers wavered as the grass
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of a cornfield wavers when the ears are swept
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        By the breath of brown reapers singing as they pass,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or grass of woody glades when a wind that has slept
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Wakens, and invades their moonlit solitude,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        When the hazels shiver and the birch is blown
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To a billow of silver, but oaks in the wood

      <div class="line">
        Stand firm nor quiver, stand firm as stone:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So, amid the sleepers, the black eunuchs stood.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        When the sleepers stirred faintly in the heat
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of that painted room a silken sound I heard,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And a thin music, sweet as the brown nightingale
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sings in the jealous shade of a lonely spinney,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Stranger far than any music mortal made
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Fell softer than the dew falleth when stars are pale.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sweet it was, and clear as light, or as the tears
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That sad Narcissus wears in the spring of the year
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        On barren mountain ranges where rain falls cool
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And every lonely pool is sprayed with broken light:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So cool, so beautiful, and so divinely strange
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I doubted if it came from any marshy reed
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or hollow fluting stem pluck'd by the hands of men,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unless it were indeed that airy fugitive
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Syrinx, who cried and ran before the laughing eyes
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of goat-footed Pan, and must for ever live
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A shadowy green reed by an Arcadian river--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But never music made of Ladon's reedy daughter
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or singing river-water more sweet than that which stole,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slow as amber honey wells from the honeycomb,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Into my weary soul with solace and strange peace.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So, trembling as I lay in a dream more desolate
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Than is the darkened day of the mid-winter north,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I heard the voice of one who sang in a strange tongue,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And I know not what he sang save that he sang of love,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The while they led me forth unheeding, till we came
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unto a chamber lit with one slow-burning flame
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That yellow horn bedims, and laid me down, and there
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        They soothed my bruised limbs, and combed my tangled hair,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And salved my limbs with rarely-mingled unguents pressed
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        By hands of holy ones who dream beneath the suns
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of Araby the Blest, and so, when they had bathed
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        My burning eyes with milk of dreamy anodyne
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And cool'd my throat with wine,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In robings of cool silk my broken body they swathed,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sandals of gold they placed upon my feet, and round
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        My sad sun-blistered brows a silver fillet bound--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Decking me with the pride of a bridegroom that goes
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To the joy of his bride and is lovely in her eyes--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And led me to her side. Then, as a conquering prince,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I, who long since had been battered and tost
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Like a dead leaf or ghost buffeted by wild storms,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Came to her white arms, conquering, and was lost,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Yet dared not gaze upon the beauty that I dreamed.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So, in my trance, it seemed that a shadowy soft dance
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Coiled slowly and unwound, swayed, beckoned, and recovered
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As hooded cobra bound by hollow spells of sound
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unto the piper sways; so silently they hovered
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I only heard the beat of their naked feet,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And then, another sound....
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A dull throb thrumming, a noise of faint drumming,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Threatening, coming nearer, piercing deeper
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Than a dream lost in the heart of a sleeper
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Into those deeps where the dark fire gloweth,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The secret flame that every man knoweth,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Embers that smoulder, fires that none can fan,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Terrible, older than the mind of man....
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Before he crawled from his swamp and spurned
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The life of the beast that dark fire burned
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In the hidden deeps where no dream can come:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Only the throbbing of a drum
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Can wake it from its smouldering--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sightless, soundless, senseless, dumb--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Dumb as those blind seeds that lie
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Drown'd in mud, and shuddering,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        I knew that I was man no more,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But a throbbing core of flesh, that knew
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Nor beauty, nor truth, nor anything
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But the black sky and the slimy earth:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Roots of trees, and fear, and pain,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The blank of death, the pangs of birth,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        An inhuman thing possess'd
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        By the throbbing of a drum:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And my lips were strange and numb,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But they kissed her white breast....
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then, being drunk with pride and splendour of love, I cried:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        '"O spring of all delight, O moonèd mystery,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        O living marvel, white as the dead queen of night,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        O flower, and O flame ... tell me at least thy name
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That, from this desolate height, I may proclaim its wonder
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        To the lost lands hereunder before thy beauty dies
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As fades the fire of dawn upon a peak of snow!"'
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then: "Look," she sighed, "into my eyes, and thou shalt know."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        So, with her fingers frail, she pressed my brows, and so,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Slowly, at last, she raised my drooping eyelids pale,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And in her eyes I gazed.
      </div>
      <div class="inner line-block">
        <div class="inner line-block">
          <div class="line">
            'Then fear, than love more blind,

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Caught at my heart and fast in chains of horror bound--
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        As one who in profound and midnight forest ways
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Sees in the dark the burning eyes of a tiger barred
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or stealthy footed pard blaze in a solemn hate
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And lust of human blood, yet cannot cry, nor turning
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Flee from the huddled wood, but stands and sees his fate,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or one who in a black night, groping for his track,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Clings to the dizzy verge of a cragged precipice,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Shrinks from the dim abyss, yet dare not venture back,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And no sound hears but the hiss of empty air
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Swirling past his ears.... So, in a hideous
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Abandonment of hope, I waited for her kiss.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then the restless beat of the muttering drum
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rose to a frenzied heat; the naked dancers leapt
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Insolent through the flame, laughing as they came
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        With parted lips; their cries deadened my ears, my eyes
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Throbbed with the pattering of their rapid feet,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And the whirling dust of their dancing swept
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Into my throat unslaked, dry-parchèd with love's drought,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Until my mouth was pressed upon her burning mouth
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In a kiss most terrible.... Oh, was it pride, or shame
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unending, without name, or ecstasy, or pain
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Or desperate desire? Alas! I cannot tell,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Save that it pierced my trembling soul and body with fire.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        For, while her soft lips clove to mine in love, she drove
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A flaming blade of steel into my breast, and I,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Rent with a bitter cry, slid from her side and fell
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Clutching in dumb despair the dark unbraided hair
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        My passion had despoiled; while she, like serpent coiled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Poised for another stroke, terribly, slowly, smiled,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Saying: "O stranger, red, red are my lips, and sweet
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unto those lips so red are the kisses of the dead:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Far hast thou wandered, far, for the kisses of Thamar."
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then a deep silence fell on the frenzy and the laughter;
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        The leaping dancers crept to the shadows where they had slept,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And the mute eunuchs stood forth, and hugely bent
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Above my body, spent in its pool of blood,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And hove me with black arms, while the queen followed after
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        With stealthy steps, and eyes that burned into the night
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Of my dying brain, till, with her hand, she bade
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Them falter, and they stayed, while, eagerly, she propped
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        My listless head that dropped downward from my shoulders,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And slowly raised it up, raised it like a cup
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Unto her lips again,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Then shuddered, trembled, shrunk, as though her mouth had drunk
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        A potion where the fell fire of poison smoulders.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And a darkness came, and I could see no more,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But in my ears the roar of lonely torrents swelled
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And stilled my breath for ever, as though a wave appalling
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Had broken in my brain, and deep to deep were calling:
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And I felt my body falling down and down and down
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Into a blank of death, where dumb waters roll
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Endlessly, only knowing, that her dagger had stabbed my breast,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        But her kiss had killed my soul.
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And now I know no rest until again I stand
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Where that lost city's towers rise from the dreamy sand,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Until I reach the gate where the lips of Asia wait,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Till I cross the desert's drought, and the rivers of the south,
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        And shiver through the night under those summits white
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        That soar above Cathay; until I see the light
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        Flame from those tyrannous glooms where, like a tired star
      </div>
      <div class="line">
        In stormy darkness, looms the castle of Thamar.'
